//     title: 'Spreading the spirit of mental revolution through competition',
//     content: `The Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs recently held an award ceremony to honor the winners of its latest contest promoting the values of the National Mental Revolution Movement.
//
// Each contestant in this year's iteration of the competition was required to create a work of art that could inspire the public to transform their way of living through “mental revolution.”
//
// A term coined by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, mental revolution refers to the methods by which Indonesians can improve their way of thinking and behavior so that they may perform at their best and achieve great things as individuals.
//
// This revolution, in its concrete elements, consists of positive approaches, such as aiming for productivity, cooperation, solidarity, a sense of responsibility, self-discipline and respecting law and order.
//
// To this end, President Jokowi has proclaimed the importance of a National Mental Revolution Movement, a goal that has been codified through Presidential Instruction No. 12/2016.
//
// This year's contest, which ran from May to August, serves to further President Widodo's vision of a mental revolution in society through the artistic media of photographs, videos, songs and comic strips, which comprise the competition's four categories.
//
// According to Iwan Eka Setiawan, who is the assistant deputy for values and cultural creativity at the ministry, the contest aims to spread awareness of and inspire mental revolution.
//
// “The meaning and aim of this activity is to familiarize the National Mental Revolution Movement and to find out just how far the public’s understanding goes in terms of the values of mental revolution,” Setiawan said, during the contest's awards ceremony, held on Oct. 20 at the minister’s heritage building.
//
// The 700 participants this year made a total of 1,742 submissions to the four contest categories, with themes based on various government mental revolution programs, such as Clean Indonesia, Indonesia Serves, Orderly Indonesia, Independent Indonesia and United Indonesia.
//
// Through works of art that raise awareness of the importance of mental revolution, the government hopes that the public can understand why such a revolution is necessary, and more importantly, how ordinary citizens can play an active role in achieving this goal.
//
// “We hope that this activity can trigger society’s concern for mental revolution so that they can realize the importance of active public participation in creating an exemplary society for progress,” Setiawan added.
//
// Winners of this year's contest hailed from all over the archipelago, from places such as Greater Jakarta, Surakarta in Central Java, Banjarmasin and North Hulu Sungai regency in South Kalimantan, and Denpasar in Bali.
//
// Contest prizes varied. For example, the first, second and third place winners of the photo contest won Rp 10 million, Rp 7 million and Rp 5 million, respectively.
//
// Meanwhile, the top-two winners of the comic strip contest were given iPad Pro units (with first place getting a 12-inch version and the runner-up winning a 9.5-inch model), with the third place winner getting Rp 4 million.
//
// One of the winners this year was Frederich Blessy, a Balinese student from the Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Denpasar, who won third place in the video contest category.
//
// His video, titled It Starts with the Little Things (which can be viewed on Blessy's Instagram profile at @Notblessy), aims at raising awareness of the importance of maintaining a clean Indonesia.
//
// Throughout the minute-long video, Blessy contrasts idyllic shots of the country's natural beauty with sobering images of litter-strewn environments.
//
// The video ends with a direct message to the viewer to love Indonesia by starting off with “the little things,” in this case specifically referring to proper disposal of waste.
//
// Blessy was inspired by the sight of so many of the popular tourist areas in his native Bali covered in litter.
//
// According to Blessy, most people know Bali as a beautiful place, but because many don't keep it clean, visitors end up getting a reality check and leave wondering why the place is so dirty.
//
// “If Indonesia is so beautiful, then why aren't we protecting it? So great is Indonesian nature's love for us, and despite all we've done to it, Indonesia still loves us at the end of the day. So why aren't we protecting it? Why aren't we paying it back in kind with these small acts, like properly disposing of waste?” Blessy asked.
//
// Another winner this year was Jefry Albari Tribowo and his band JEF. Together they won third place in the songwriting contest category for their song, “Mental Revolution,” which can be listened to at the contest's official YouTube page.
//
// Tribowo, a doctor from RS Ansari Saleh Regional General Hospital in Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan, wanted to communicate the points of mental revolution through song so that everyone could understand its message and meaning. The song's lyrics describe the five aspects of mental revolution.
//
// “As a doctor, I want all workers in Indonesia to apply the aspects of mental revolution, such as the Indonesia Serves and the Clean Indonesia movements. All of this has to be applied in our day-to-day lives. If we apply the values of mental revolution, we will have a better life and be useful to other people,” Tribowo said.
//
// The government hopes that the artwork of everyday people like Blessy, Tribowo and other winners can be used to inspire mental revolution among the people.
//
// “The goal is to involve the public through valued works of art that are from different parts of society as examples of mental change. We will spread their art far and wide as part of our public familiarization with mental revolution,” Setiawan said, who was also one of the judges at this year's competition.`,
